  ## Description  

  This app serves to connect book lovers to other readers who would like to participate in a virtual book club experience together. Bookish users connect in “clubs”, where       they commit to reading a specific book within a specified timeframe. Users can find the club they want to join by searching for a book by author; once found, Bookish will     display a list of clubs that are currently reading said book. The user can choose to join one of those clubs, or start their own. In order to keep users on track and           to and to mimic the cozy, intimate feeling of in-person book clubs, discussion groups will be limited to a maximum of 10 users. 

  AS A book reader
  I WANT to find new and exciting books to read. 
  WHEN I find a book I'm interested in,
  I WANT to join a club as well 
  SO THAT I can discuss the book with other readers.
